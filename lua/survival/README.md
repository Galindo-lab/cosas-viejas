Where to put stuff
Generally I use the following structure :
	  data/ - assets. Fonts, music, graphics, etc. Also might hold map files if we end up using Tiled or something.
	  game/ - game logic. If you want to make balance tweaks or add new stuff, it's in here.
	  lib/ - libraries. Most love2d libraries have really awful names. Please understand.
	  framework/ - generic code i use in all projects.

	  conf.lua - config file. not intended to be edited by end-users, but you might be interested in tweaking a few of these things.
	  main.lua - main game loop. fundamental stuff. duhhruhurh.
